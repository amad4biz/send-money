[![Send Money App](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/halahtouryalai/files/2013/03/1028_retire-early-kids-baby-money_380x278.jpg)](https://github.com/slkuo230/send-money)

## Installation:
1. `git clone https://github.com/slkuo230/send-money`

2. `npm install`

3. to test, simple run: `grunt` (There is only one task registered.)


## Note:

1. If npm install is complaining about 'module xchange' not found, it's probably because there is a problem with npm cloning the module from my git repo.

2. Easiest fix is to manually `git clone https://github.com/slkuo230/xchange`
